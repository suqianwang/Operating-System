# The Data Server Moved Out!

In this machine problem we improve the request channel to provide communication across the network. Specifically, we allow the the client-side end of a request channel to reside on one machine, and the server-side end of the channel on another machine. The communication over a request channel is to be provided by a single TCP connection.
